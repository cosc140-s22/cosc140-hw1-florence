        <dt> Cardiff Castle <img src= 'https://www.planetware.com/wpimages/2019/06/wales-cardiff-top-attractions-cardiff-castle.jpg' class='boxpic'> </dt> <dd>  Beautifully built and rich with history, one can spend many hours exploring the lively nooks and crannies of the Cardiff Castle, located conveniently in city centre. We spent multiple days here between classes. Since there are multiple sections of the castle to visit, we unconvered endless surprises! The main house includes the extensive library, stunning Moroccan room, and the glorious dining room with the friezes and stained glass windows. We also climbed to the top of fort in the center of the courtyard, where we got a breathtakingly unique perspective of the city. Finally, our favorite part was the tunnels underneath the castle wall which served as WWII bunkers! </dd>

        <dt> Cardiff University <img src= 'https://cardiff.imgix.net/__data/assets/image/0015/143106/JP-outside-low-resolution.jpg?w=873&ar=16:9&q=80&auto=format' class='boxpic'> </dt>
        <dd> Every brochure and google search of Cardiff University displays the main building, which is stands strong and majestically across from the SU. However, I've chosen a picture of John Percival, the building where we have our weekly AMAZING cs course and other interesting Welsh courses. Though it is certainly not as beautiful as Hamilton, I have fallen in love with this campus and attending college in a city! I've loved the relaxing strolls to classes, getting lunch afterwards, the accesibility to city center, and not to mention the beautiful trees of campus! </dd>

      <dt> Bristol <img src='https://media.istockphoto.com/photos/clifton-suspension-bridge-river-avon-bristol-england-picture-id471787321?b=1&k=20&m=471787321&s=170667a&w=0&h=yqlJ9H3FqE40d2cm2nJetbDKF5QVwLho6j7D5a1-xT8=' class="boxpic"> </dt>

         A couple weekends ago we took a train to the nearby city of Bristol. The train was quick and fairly easy to nagivate! I definitely hope to use the train system more often to explore more of the  UK. In Bristol, the first thing we did was get food of course!!! As we made our way towards St. Nicholas Market for food, we passed by St Mary Redcliffe, a beautiful 12th century church. We also came across an abandoned 11th century church, which stood tucked away behind modern shops and buildings. A true shame to see history be neglected as such! After exploring the various shops filled with delectable goodies, we finally gorged ourselves on the food stalls from all the corners of the world! When we were satisfied we went to Bristol Cathedral, with parts of it dating back to before the 11th century. It blew our minds that such an old structure still stood so sturdy and elegant. Finally we ended our day by watching the "sunset" (in quotations because as the UK is known for, the sun is a myth) at the Clifton Suspension Bridge. Overall, a fun day trip! I loved that Bristol felt much more European with it's old Gothic structures.  </dd>
